Hi,

My name is Venkatesh and i teamed up with Aditya at PennApps to develop a mobile application called 'Social Alarm' a cross platform alarm mobile application which embarrasses(sometimes) you, but wake you up for sure.

When you snooze this alarm,we either push a text message to your friend or push a facebook status.

We also plan to add features to make a group alarm along with your friends and sending a sorry,i will be late email automatically in our next releases.

We used intel xdk, Nexmo API's & regular web technologies to develop this app.

Hope all lazy asses like me love this app :D

Thanks.

Social Alarm
